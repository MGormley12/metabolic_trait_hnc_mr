metabolic_trait_mr.R contains all the necessary code to run the primary two-sample MR analyses or instrument-risk factor analyses.

Other files contain input and output data for the code in metabolic_trait_mr.R, except for extraction data from the oral and oropharyngeal cancer GWAS i.e., "bmi_hnc.txt", "bmi_oc.txt" or "bmi_opc.txt" as data be obtained from the OncoArray: Oral and Pharynx Cancer; study accession number: phs001202.v1.p1, August 2017 at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001202.v1.p1![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54310353/183934376-f117ac62-aa90-406f-9d33-da1a50420e7a.png) or IEU OpenGWAS
